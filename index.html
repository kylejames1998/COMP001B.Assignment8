        <h1>What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h1>
        <p>I really think showing up to class and listening to the lectures as well as being able to ask questions was a huge reasoning behind my success in this course. Also, the video lectures really helped me too, especially when I was having troubles with a specific topic or was unable to replicate what we were learning.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>What would you change about the course?</h1>
        <p>The only thing I would change about this course is to add some team related activities, such as reviewing our classmates code for errors and bugs. Aside from that, I wouldn't change anything.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course? </h1>
        <p>To be honest, I thought we would learn a bit more than we did, however I understand that the course is short-term so our time was limited.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered in the past?</h1>
        <p>Most of the concepts I was already familiar with, aside from the Grid System and some of the bootstrap topics. I was already familiar with the box model, typography, and colors.</p>
